# About
Software engineering is a discipline in learning to communicate with other software.
It is a skill translating your intention into deterministic, reproducable,
and logically consistent code. The skillset required for writing software is a completly
separate from learning to write code.  Effective software engineering comes from
1. Maticulous attention to detail
2. Hygenic file management processes
3. Resilent design
4. Problem decomposition

While the "Intro to C Programming" course will teach you the language necessary to
communicate with the machine, the aim of this series of talks is to prepare you to deal
with all of the headaches that come with operating software and working within a 
"development environment"

It is my objective to have one of these talks every two to three weeks to give you a 
head start in "software engineering" so that once it is time to learn how to code,
you don't end up wasting hours, days, and weeks dealing with easily avoidable headaches
that waste your time. The current schedule I'll be running is a follows

| Date       | Topic                      |
| ---        | ---                        |
| 24.10.02   | Preparing your Environment |
| 24.10.16   | Build toools               |
| TBD        | Package Management         |

Generally speaking, for every hour of time you spend writing production code (code
that eventually compiles to a useful binary) you should expect to spend 4 hours
debugging, testing, managing, documenting, and reviewing.  Alot sufficient time in your
schedule for this work!
